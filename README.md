# User-Scripts
A collection of short random scripts I made that aren't worthy of a standalone repository.  
Browser userscripts require an addons like [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) to install and run.

## Bash Scripts:
### CreateLinks:
A Bash script to generate symlink for each media file within folder (works with single files, folders, and nested folders).

Usage: ```CreateLinks <Source Directory> <Destination Directory>```

### ExtractSubs:
A Bash script to extract specific subtitles ID from mkv files (used mainly to extract subtitles in a specific language from all episodes of a TV series) 

  Usage: ```ExtractSubs <File / Directory> <Track ID> <Extracted File Type (File Extension)> [<Filename Suffix>]```
