# User-Scripts
A collection of short random scripts I made that aren't worthy of a standalone repository.  
Browser userscripts require an addons like [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) to install and run.

## Browser Userscripts:
### TheWorker-Bypass:
A script for removing blur and registration banner, and enabling right mouse click and text selection on [theworker.co.il](https://theworker.co.il).

## Bash Scripts:
### CreateLinks:
A Bash script to generate symlink for each media file within folder (works with single files, folders, and nested folders).

Usage: ```CreateLinks <Source Directory> <Destination Directory>```

<br />

### ExtractSubs:
A Bash script to extract specific subtitles ID from mkv files (used mainly to extract subtitles in a specific language from all episodes of a TV series).
Requires ffmpeg to be installed to work.

Usage: ```ExtractSubs <File / Directory> <Track ID> <File Format>```
