# User-Scripts

A collection of user-scripts and shell scripts that aren't worthy of a standalone repository.

## Contents

This repository is organized into two categories:

### [Browser User-Scripts](browser-userscripts/)
Browser user-scripts for various useful use-cases. These scripts require a browser add-on like [Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) to be installed.

See the [browser-userscripts README](browser-userscripts/README.md) for detailed information about available userscripts and installation instructions.

### [Shell Scripts](shell-scripts/)
Bash scripts for various media processing and file management tasks.

See the [shell-scripts README](shell-scripts/README.md) for detailed information about available scripts and usage instructions.
